Snowflake Data Engineering Project: Amazon Sales Data Analysis
Project Overview
This project demonstrates a Snowflake-based data engineering pipeline to load and analyze Amazon sales data. The dataset includes information on products, sales, and customer demographics to provide insights into sales performance and customer behavior.

Dataset
The dataset comes from publicly available Amazon sales data (or a specific Kaggle dataset if applicable).

Files Used:
sales_data.csv: Contains details about product sales, including order ID, product information, and sales amount.
customer_data.csv: Includes demographic details about customers.
product_data.csv: Contains information about products, such as category and price.
Steps in the Project
Data Loading:

Loaded sales_data.csv, customer_data.csv, and product_data.csv from an S3 bucket into Snowflake using the COPY INTO command.

Table Creation:

Created tables for SalesData, CustomerData, and ProductData in Snowflake to store sales, customer, and product information.

Data Transformation:

Added a High_Value_Sale column to flag transactions above a certain sales threshold.
Joined SalesData with CustomerData and ProductData to create a consolidated view for analysis.

Data Analysis:

Ran SQL queries to analyze average sales by product category, customer location, and seasonal trends.
Calculated the top-selling products and the total revenue generated by each customer segment.

Future Work
Integrate additional datasets for inventory and supplier information.
Build predictive models to forecast sales and customer purchase behavior.
Technologies Used:
Snowflake: For data warehousing and SQL-based data processing.
AWS S3: Used for storing raw sales data.
